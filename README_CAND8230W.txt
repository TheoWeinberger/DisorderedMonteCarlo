This README is a catalogue of the code used in this project.
.c code was used to run simulations and produce data
.py code was used to analyse data and produce plots
For full descriptions of what each piece of code does check the individual files.

For random number generation the seed was generated by seed_rng() which used the /dev/urandom
file to collect a random seed. This code was as seen on 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2572366/how-to-use-dev-random-or-urandom-in-c
As this is linux only code this could be used on the CSD3 but not a windows laptop.
On windows standard time seeding was used. This could not be used on the CSD3 as 
multiple iterations of the program were called simultaneously. 

The key pieces of code used to run simulations were 
IsingDisorderBatchEASubLattices.c - Thermodynamic simulations
LatticeGenerate.c - produces lattice for simulations to be run off
StructureFactorBatch.c - structure factor calculations



Other pieces of .c code
Autocorrelation.c
AutocorrelationCurves.c 
AutocorrelationDisorder.c
CorrelationLengths.c
IsingFCCAFMBatch.c
IsingFCCFMBatch.c 
RealSpaceCorrelation.c
